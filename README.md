# Prioritizing_system
This system automates triage. It cleans messy logs and uses a weighted formula—Impact, Urgency, and Reliability—to rank tasks. By scoring incidents, it ensures engineers fix critical failures first and ignore noise. It turns data into clear actions, saving time and reducing stress.
